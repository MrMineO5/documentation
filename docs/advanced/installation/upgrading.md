# Upgrade Source++

We recommend that you upgrade Source++ often to stay up to date with the latest fixes and enhancements.
In order to make this a reality, Source++ upgrades are backward compatible and the upgrade process is simple and quick.

Upgrading is generally safe (between many minor and one major version) and functionality will fundamentally operate the same.
There may be minor breaking changes in some edge cases, which are outlined in the [Release Notes](#) and [Changelog](https://github.com/sourceplusplus/live-platform/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
