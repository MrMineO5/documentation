The Live Command Palette (LCP) is a contextual command prompt, included in the [JetBrains Plugin](../tools/clients/jetbrains-plugin.md), that allows developers to control and query live applications from their IDE. Opened via keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+S`), the LCP allows developers to easily view metrics relevant to the source code they're currently viewing.
