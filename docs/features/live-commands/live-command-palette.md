# Live Command Palette

The **Live Command Palette** (LCP) is a contextual command prompt, included in the [JetBrains Plugin](../../technology/clients/jetbrains-plugin.md), that allows developers to control and query live applications from their IDE. Opened via keyboard shortcut (++ctrl+shift+s++), the LCP allows developers to easily view metrics relevant to the source code they're currently viewing.
