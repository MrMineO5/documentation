# Production Awareness

**Live Views** are designed for increasing application comprehension and awareness. Unlike [Live Instruments](../live-instruments), which are designed for debugging live applications, Live Views are designed for understanding the behavior of a live application. Live Views are typically more permanent than Live Instruments as they are not automatically expired or removed from the application.
