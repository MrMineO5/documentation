# Introduction

Live Breakpoints, also referred to as "non-breaking breakpoints", are debugging instruments that can be placed in production applications during runtime. These breakpoints look and feel like conventional breakpoints except for the key difference in that live breakpoints do not pause or halt the current execution but rather record the current execution, allowing developers to debug production via retrospect.

## Creating Breakpoints

Once setup, live breakpoints are created just like conventional breakpoints. You set live breakpoints by left-clicking the gutter on the desired source code line and select **Live Breakpoint**.
